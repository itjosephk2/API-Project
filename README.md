# API Project
This is a short project on learning how to interact with API's in JS. The interface takes in javascript code through either a url or pastebin. You can set parameters for checking the code like ES6, jquery etc. 
There is an error handling process and the information is displayed to a modal. The project follows an MVC approach with the display functions and logic functions being seperated.
